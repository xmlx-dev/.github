# Explainable Machine Learning, Explained :bulb: #

A growing collection of resources about Machine Learning eXplainability.
Our objective is to cover both theory and practice, including:

* high-level overviews & introductory examples;
* mathematical foundations;
* algorithmic implementations;
* practical advice & real-life caveats; and
* success & failure case studies.

We will be adding more eXplainable Machine Learning techniques
to our compendium over time, so stay tuned.
Cannot wait?
